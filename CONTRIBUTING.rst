How To Contribute
-----------------

sss3 is always open for suggestions and contributions by generous developers.
You can join my `SSS3 Slack channel`_. I will invite you if you leave your email in AUTHORS file.
Here are a few tips to get you started.

Please:

- Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.
- *Always* add tests and docs for your code.
- Add yourself to the AUTHORS file in an alphabetical fashion, and add your
  name to the license header of the files you modify.
- Write `good commit messages`_.
- Ideally, squash_ your commits, i.e. make your pull requests just one commit.
- Use a branch, it will be easier to squash or rebase on upstream's master.

Thank you for considering to contribute to sss3!
